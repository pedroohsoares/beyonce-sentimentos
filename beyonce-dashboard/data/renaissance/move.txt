Move out the way
I'm with my girls and we all need space (Woo)
When the queen's come through don't try like the rest say
Move out the way, how many times have I said?
It's a home run when the team turns this

Rock a bitch, rock a bitch, rock up (Rock up)
Fumble like we 'bout to come up (Hm)
Want me to get turn up, make it trouble
'Cause we coming straight out the jungle (Grace)
Rock a bitch, rock a bitch, rock up (Grace Jones)
Fumble like we 'bout to come up (Grace Jones)
Want me to get turn up, make it troublе
'Cause we coming straight out the junglе

Move, move, move, move
Yeah, you gotta move, move
Anything you do
Will be held against you
You have to move, move, move, move
Skrrt off, make room
Stampede coming through
Big boss on the mood
Yeah, (Oh, oh, oh, oh) bounce it
Everybody around it, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Bounce it (Bounce it)
Pick it up like you found it (Found it)

Me and my girlfriends came out to play (Play)
Eye looks and champagne, Chantilly lace
Broken glass in the disco sits in the grey (Ah)
Watch my reflection, fuck out my face

Move out the way
I'm with my girls and we all need space (Mm)
When the queen's come through don't try like the rest say
Move out the way, how many times have I said?
It's a home run when the team turns this
