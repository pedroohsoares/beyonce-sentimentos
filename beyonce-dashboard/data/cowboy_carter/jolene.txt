(Jolene)

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm warnin' you, don't come for my man (Jolene)
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Don't take the chance because you think you can

You're beautiful beyond compare
Takes more than beauty and seductive stares
To come between a family and a happy man
Jolene, I'm a woman too
Thе games you play are nothing new
So you don't want no hеat with me, Jolene
We been deep in love for twenty years
I raised that man, I raised his kids
I know my man better than he knows himself (Hah, wait)
I can easily understand why you're attracted to my man
But you don't want this smoke
So shoot your shot with someone else (You heard me)

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm warnin' you, woman, find you your own man
Jolene, I know I'm a queen, Jolene
I'm still a Creole banjee bitch
From Louisiana' (Don't try me)

There's a thousand girls in every room
That act as desperate as you do
You a bird, go on and sing your tune
Jolene (What?)
I had to have this talk with you
'Cause I hate to have to act the fool
Your peace depends on how you move, Jolene

Me and my man crossed those valleys
Highs and lows and everything between
You did roll in like tumbling weeds
I sleep good happy
'Cause you can't dig up our planted seeds
I know my man's gon' stand by me
Breathing in my gentle breeze (Ah)
I crossed those valleys
Highs and lows and everything between
You did roll in like tumbling weeds
Good and happy
'Cause you can't dig up our planted seeds
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'ma stand by her, she will stand by me, Jolene

I'ma stand by him, he gon' stand by me
(I'ma stand by her, she gon' stand by me)
I'ma stand by him, he gon' stand by me, Jolene
