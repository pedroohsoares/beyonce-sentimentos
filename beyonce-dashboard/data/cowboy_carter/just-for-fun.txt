I'm goin' all out just for fun
I am the man, I know it
And everywhere I go, they know my name
So I laugh and I lie and the coyotes cry
And, uh, time moves quickly and so do I, so do I
So I'll say my goodbye

'Cause time heals everything
I don't need anything
Hallelujah
I pray to her

Here's to hoping
I'll fall fast asleep tonight
And I'll just need to get through this
Born in the darkness, who brings the light?
And I just, I need to get through this
Or just get used to it

I'm goin' down south just for fun
I am the man, I know it
And everywhere I go, I hide my face
From the cowboys in Clovis and the rodeo circus
I came here for a reason, but I don't know the purpose
It's all under the surface

But time heals everything
I don't need anything
Hallelujah
I pray to her

Here's to hoping
I'll fall fast asleep tonight
And I'll just need to get through this
Born in the darkness, who brings the light?
And I just, I need to get through this
Or just get used to it

'Cause time heals everything
I don't need anything
Hallelujah
I pray to her
I pray to her
