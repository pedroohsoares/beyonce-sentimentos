Mom, can I hear the lullaby?
Please?

And there I was, tangled up in marigold
We were listenin' to the reverent children singin'
(Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing) Hm, yeah
Hummin' low as the garden river flows
While the August light becomes a golden evenin'
(Evenin') Yeah

And I will lead you down that road if you lose your way
Born to be a protector, mm-hmm
Even though I know someday you're gonna shine on your own
I will be your projector, mm, mm-hmm

An apricot picked right off a given tree
I gave watеr to the soil
And now it feeds me, yeah, yеah (Yeah)
And there you are, shaded underneath it all
I feel proud of who I am
Because you need me, yeah (Yeah)

And I will lead you down that road if you lose your way (Uh)
Born to be a protector (—tor), mm
Even though I know someday you're gonna shine on your own
I will be your projector, hm-mm
And even though I know someday
you're gonna shine on your own
I will be your projector, projector, projector

I first saw your face in your father's gaze
There's a long line of hands carryin' your name, mm
Liftin' you up, so you will be raised

Even though I know someday you're gonna shine on your own
I will be your projector, hey-yeah
And even though I know someday
you're gonna shine on your own
I will be your protector, born to be a protector

Okay
