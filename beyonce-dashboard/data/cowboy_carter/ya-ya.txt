Hello, girls (Hello, Beyoncé)
Hello, fellas (You're pretty swell)
Those petty ones can't fuck with me (Why?)

My family live and died in America, hm
Good ol' USA, shit (Good ol' USA)
Whole lotta red in that white and blue, huh
History can't be erased, ooh
You lookin' for a new America? (America)
Are you tired, workin' time
and a half for half the pay? (Woo-hoo)
Ya-ya (Half the pay, oh-oh)
I just pray that we don't crash
Keep my Bible on the dash
We gotta keep the faith
Wildfire burnt his house down
Insurance ain't gon' pay no Fannie Mae, shit
So hold this holster, pour mo' liquor, please
Hard workin' man ain't got no money in the bank
Huh, the ya-ya
Turn up the vinyl and the radio (Radio)
He can't watch the news nowadays (Nowadays)
Oh, I just pray that he don't crash
keep his pistol on the dash
He gotta keep the faith

He's lookin' for sweet sensations

Keep my Bible on the dash
His pistol in my seat, just in case I gotta blast
I just wanna shake my ass (Have a blast), ooh

And lover boy, you're so fine
Ooh, you got me losin' my mind
But you gotta keep the faith
