I fall to pieces
Each time I see you there
And I miss all our secrets
So tell me how you've been

Lucchese the boots, check
You can hear when I step, step
Bought a Chevy and painted it red
Money long, it can't fit in the bed
It don't matter what nobody says
Country boy 'til the day that I'm dead (Yee-hoo)
You want smoke, I'm the Marlboro man
Cut it out 'fore it get outta hand, ayy
This ain't Calabasas, we don't need highways
We can take backroads (Take backroads)
Never been ridin', baby? Step in that stirrup
Hop on my saddle (Hop on my saddle)
Snake on my feet, they rattle (Ooh)
And the bag, only thing gettin' lasso'd, yeah
(Gettin' what?)
And I'm still goin' up like a ladder (Uh)
And I'm still in the field like cattle

The Cadillac back on the road, we takin' route 44
Just say what you need from the store, oh, oh
Put some grits on the stove
Jiffy cornbread, booty cornfed
Body rolls at the rodeo
I'm coming home, ooh
Ridin' through just to put my eyes on you
You are the superstar
Everybody's drivin' old new cars
Turn a bad night to a good time
On a trail ride to the zydeco
I'm coming home

I'm coming home
(I'm coming home, I'm coming home)
I'm coming home
(I'm coming home, I'm coming home)
We've come a long way from the rough ride
From the railroads to the rodeos, sweet country home

This for my, this for my
She gone
Ride for your cowboy
And throw that sweet honey on it
So come (So come) with me (With me)
To new life (Sticky, sticky, sticky, sweet)

You're stuck (You're stuck) to me (To me)
All night (Sticky, sticky, sticky, sweet)

Stuck in me all night

Fuck it, do it again (That's cool)
A-O-T-Y, I ain't win (That's cool)
I ain't stuntin' 'bout them
Take that shit on the chin
Come back and fuck up the pen (Yeah)

Say the things that I know will offend (Huh, yeah)
Wear that shit that I know start a trend (Uh)
Take the Bugatti out for the spin (Ooh)
Ain't no top, feel the wind on my skin
Ooh, ooh, ooh, snakes on the den (Uh)

They bite every once and again (Uh-huh)

Promisin' things that they can't (Things that they can't)

Buckin' like a mechanical bull
