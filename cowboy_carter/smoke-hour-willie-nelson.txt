(People grinnin' in your face)
(That's why I'm going to the river
to wash my sins away)
(Maybellene, why can't you be true?)
(Come on, baby, it's time to rock)
(Don't let go, don't let go)

Welcome to "The Smoke Hour" on KNTRY Radio Texas
You know my name, no need to know yours
Now for this next tune
I want y'all to sit back, inhale
And go to the good place your mind likes to wander off to
And if you don't wanna go, go find yourself a jukebox
Thank you
