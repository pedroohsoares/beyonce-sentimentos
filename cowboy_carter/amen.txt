Mercy on me, baby
Have mercy on me (Mercy, mercy)
Hurtin' badly, I can see you're hurtin' badly
Hurtin', hurtin', hey
Mercy on me, baby
Have mercy on me (Mercy, mercy)
I see you hurtin', see you
Please, have mercy on me (Oh-oh, ooh)
(Mercy, mercy)

This house was built with blood and bone
And it crumbled, yes, it crumbled
The statues they made were beautiful
But they were lies of stone, they werе lies of stone
Trumpets blarе with silent sound
I need to make you proud
Tell me, can you hear me now?

Mercy on me, mercy
Have mercy on me
(Mercy, yeah, mercy, yeah)
I can see you hurtin' badly, see you hurtin' badly
(Can see you hurtin', see you hurtin' badly)
(Mercy, mercy)

Say a prayer for what has been
We'll be the ones to purify our Fathers' sins
American Requiem
Them old ideas (Yeah) are buried here (Yeah)
Amen (Amen)
