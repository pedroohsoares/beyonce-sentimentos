My mind has been tellin' me
to settle right on down (Ooh)
Right now
Day ones have been tellin' me
that they won't be around (Ooh)
They won't be around

I hope that you know that once I loved you (Oh)
I wish that I'd known you'd let me wonder (Oh)
I hope that God knows
that I'm in need of help right now (Ooh)
Right about now

My soul is reminding me that we're forever young
Ooh, mmm, ooh
Inhale and exhale my breath
until the deed is done
Right about now, ayy, oh

I hope that you know once it's over
And take what you love, so hold me closer
Realize that you don't know what you got until it's gone
Right about now
