Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, no hands
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, no hands

Runnin' through the river
Runnin' through the river with you, dance (Dance)
Runnin' through the river
Runnin' through the river with you, dance (Dance)

Staring down the barrel of his gun
Yes, he shot me down
I died and someone brought me back to life
But never to my senses

Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, no hands

Staring down the barrel of my gun
Yes, I shot you down
He cried the day he realized
That lies were hidden in my kisses

Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, no hands

He was tangled in my arms
He was my mess, my ball of string
I would give him everything
My thunderstorm and second chances

Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, no hands

Runnin' through the river
Runnin' through the river with you, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, no hands

We fight but we must make amends
Arrest me and read me my rights
I plan to steal your heart again
On Saturday and Sunday nights

Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, no hands

Wrap me 'round your little finger
Wrap me 'round your wedding ring
Your words, they take the shape my body makes
Ain't that the scary thing?

Bounce on that shit, dance (Oh)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, no hands

Runnin' through the river (Dance)
Runnin' through the river with you, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, no hands

Staring at the barrel of his gun
Yes, he shot me down
I died, but then I came straight back to life
But never to my senses (Hey)
We fight but then we make amends
Arrest me and read me my rights (Hey)
I plan to steal your heart again
On Saturday and Sunday nights (Dance)

Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (We dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (We dance)
Bounce on that shit, no hands

The day I met you, I remember everything
I wrote it down
Your smile was cold, your fade was fresh
Your eyes were such a shade of brown

Bounce on that shit, dance (Oh)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Oh)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Oh)
Bounce on that shit, no hands

You press your ear onto my chest
You hear the speed my heart will beat
Seconds drag like days
Whenever you don't want to talk or speak

Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance, ooh)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance, dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Do the dance, dance)
Bounce on that shit, no hands
(Do the dance, do it again)

Runnin' through the river
Runnin' through the river with you, dance
Runnin' through the river
Runnin' through the river
Runnin' through the river (Runnin')
Runnin' through the river with you, dance (Runnin')
Runnin' through the river
Runnin' through the river (Ooh)

Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, dance (Dance)
Bounce on that shit, no hands
