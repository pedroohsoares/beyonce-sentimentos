High tides in the city, I'm in too deep
And I'm runnin' on fear
Oh, dear, you and your alligator tears
Works me over and through

You say move a mountain
And I'll throw on my boots
You say stop the river from runnin'
I'll build a dam or two
You say change religions
Now I spend Sundays with you
Somethin' 'bout those tears of yours
How does it feel to be adored?

You and your alligator tears
You and those alligator tears
You
Somethin' 'bout those tears of yours
How does it feel to be adored?

Sunrise in the morning, you're all I need
And all I need is rain or the roots get weak
Sweet things need time to grow
Thinkin' about leaving? Hell no
Squeeze every ounce of love from my body, yеah

You say move a mountain
And I'll throw on my boots
You say stop the river from runnin'
I'll build a dam or two
You say changе religion
Now I spend Sundays with you
Somethin' 'bout those tears of yours
How does it feel to be adored?

I adore you, I adore you, I adore you, I adore you
Those alligator tears
I adore you, I adore you, I adore you, I adore you
Your alligator tears
I adore you, I adore you, I adore you, I adore
Alligator tears
I adore, I adore you, I adore you
I adore, I adore (How does it feel to be adored?)
Alligator tears
