Bottle in my hand, the whiskey up high
Two hands to Heaven, wild horses run wild, oh
God only knows why, though (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Rhinestones and diamonds both shine in the light
Two hands to Heaven, my whiskey up high, oh (Oh)
God only, God only knows why, though (Oh, oh, oh)

In the Arizona heat
Summer fling saw your best side
Slip into my dreams every night, be the good guy
Who am I to judge, my baby? (Uh-uh)
Who am I to love, my baby? (Uh-uh)
Purple-colored mink
Sugarcane hittin' them sixteen switches
Candy apple green candy paint
Swirling twenty-four inch spinners (Swirl)
Don't judge me, baby (Ha)
You would never judge me, baby

Bottle in my hand, my whiskey up high
Two hands to Heaven, coyotes run wild, oh (Oh, oh)
God only, God only knows why, though (Why? Why? Why?)
Ten thousand steps towards the time of your life
Two hands to Heaven, my whiskey up high, oh (Oh)
God only, God only knows why, though
Why, though? Why, though?

Two hands to Heaven I've prayed, priest forgive my soul
Lovely daggers pierced my heart many moons ago
Toxic roses chased by wolves and carnivores
Lost virgins with broken wings that will regrow

I'm a stallion runnin', no candle in the wind
You won't ever see me comin'
or goin' but you'll know whenever I'm here
Dancin' in the moonlight, catchin' every breeze
My feet on the dashboard, now go really fast, boy
Ever since I went to Marfa
ain't no trouble on my mind
(On my mind, on my mind)
Singin' sweet songs to Las Vegas
singin', "I will carry on"
Carry on, carry on, carry on, carry on
Singin', "I will carry on"

Ten thousand steps towards the time of your life
Two hands to Heaven, my whiskey up high, oh (Oh, oh)
God only, God only knows why, though (Why, though? Why?)
Rhinestones and diamonds both shine in the light
Two hands to Heaven, coyotes run wild, oh
God only, God only knows why, though
(God only, God only knows why, though)

Two hands to Heaven I've prayed, priest forgive my soul
Lovely daggers pierced my heart many moons ago
Toxic roses chased by wolves and carnivores
Lost virgins with broken wings that will regrow

[Part II]

Swirl
Baby, I've been waitin' my whole life for you and I

This the real you, huh
This the real me, huh
They can't do nothin' but envy, ooh
Bliss, please (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Your love run through me like lava
Pull my fit over these hips
You grip, I grind
Then taste this wine, I'ma taste what's mine
'Cause I'ma take what's mine
Wonder whatever, wherever's fine
Like water, ah
Wherever you wanna go, that's fine with me
I'll never stop you, you'll never stop me
From bein' whatever we need to be
And in these dark times, I'm so glad
that this love is blinding
'Cause all I see is the best of you
and all you see is the best of me
And you bring out the best of me
And all I see is everything
Your goals, your glow, your inner being
And our bigger meaning
So, let's lose us in these sheets (Yeah)
And when I get up to walk, I wanna feel weak, yeah
Look, I ain't goin' far (Ain't goin' far)
So, stay where you are (Stay where you are)
Feel like you partied in Venus
and we woke up in Mars (Baby)
Yeah, I've been waitin' my whole life (Woo)
(I've been waitin' my whole life)
I'm gonna give you the best years
of your life (For you, and I)
You, and I
Baby, I've been waitin' my whole life for you and I
