I wanna house you and make you take my name
I'm gonna spouse you and make you tat your ring
I'm gonna take you all the way
Baby, can I take you all the way?

You sexy motherfucker, boy, you growin' on me
I just wanna thug you, the category is Bey
You gangster motherfucker, boy, you growin' on me
I just wanna touch you, I can feel it through those jeans

Ah-ah-ah-oh (Ooh)
Boy, you never have a chance
If you make my body talk, I'ma leave you in a trance
Got you walking with a limp, bet this body make you dance
Dance, dance, dance

Ooh, it's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good, it's so good
Ooh, it's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good, it's so good
(Ooh, it's so good, it's so good)
(It's so good, it's so good, it's so good)

I wanna crush you, I won't overanalyze
I'm gonna trust you even though we met tonight
But I'm gonna take you all the way
Baby, can I take you all the way?

You sexy motherfucker, boy, you growin' on me
I just wanna thug you
The category is Bey (You growin' on me)
You gangster motherfucker, boy
You growin' on me (You, you, you growin' on me)
Black silicone and rubbers
I can feel it through those jeans (Growin' on me, I)

I'm feeling way too loose to be tied down
Can you see my brain open wide now?
Come and get what I came for, hella night now
Know you love when I roleplay, who am I now?
I'm a doc, I'm a nurse, I'm a teacher
Dominate is the best way to beat ya
Sorry 'bout yesterday, now the sweet stuff
You a sweetie pie, come let me eat ya
(Fuck it up)

(Ooh)
Boy, you never have a chance
If you make my body talk, I'ma leave you in a trance
Got you walking with a limp, bet this body make you dance
Dance, dance, dance

Ooh, it's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good, it's so good
Ooh, it's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good, it's so good

Applause, a round of applause
Applause, a round of applause
