This a reminder

Damn my lover, burn another dagger
From the words that you say, fuck, yeah
Dancing in the mirror, kiss my scars
Because I love what they made, ooh, yeah

She's a god (Ah-uh), she's a hero (Ah-uh)
She survived (Ah-uh) all she been through (Ah-uh)
Confident (Ah-uh) and she lethal (Ah-uh)
Might I suggest you don't fuck with my sis (Ah-uh)
'Cause she comfortable

Comfortable in my skin
Cozy with who I am
Comfortable in my skin
Cozy, cozy
Comfortable in my skin
Feet up above your sins
I love myself, goddamn
Cozy, cozy

So cozy, I love me, they hate me
'cause they want me
I'm dark brown, dark skin, light skin, beigе
Fluorescent beigе, bitch, I'm black

Been down, been up, been broke, broke down, bounce back
Been off, been on, been back, what you know about that?
Been the light, been dark, been the truth
been that king, been energy
I been thick, been fine, still a ten
still here, that's all me
Black, black love too deep
Dance to the souls of my feet
Green eyes, envy me
Paint the world, pussy pink
Blue like the soul eyed crown
Purple drink and cole to a gown
Wall fence and shades, God made
Blue, black, white and brown
Paint the town red like cinnamon
Yellow diamonds, limoncello, glycerin
Rainbows, gelato in the streets
Renaissance, Yacht in Capri

You're a god (Ah-uh, you're a god)
you're a hero (Ah-uh-uh, you're a hero)
You survived (Ah-uh) all you been through (Ah-uh-uh)
Confident (Ah-uh-uh), damn, you lethal (Ah-uh-uh)
Might I suggest you don't fuck with my sis, uh
'Cause she comfortable

Comfortable in my skin
Cozy with who I am
Comfortable in my skin
Cozy, cozy
Comfortable in my skin
Cozy with who I am
I love myself, goddamn
Cozy, cozy (Okay)

I'm cozy (I'm cozy)
I'm juicy (I'm juicy)
You hate me (You hate me)
'Cause you want me ('Cause you want me)
I'm swaggy (I'm swaggy)
Effortlessly (Effortlessly)
That's how God made me (That's how God made me)
So bitch, pay me
(So, pay me, jingle-jing-jing-jing)
I'm black
I'm probably one of the blackest
motherfuckers walking around here
Cozy
In this motherfucking place
I'm probably one of the blackest
motherfuckers in this house
Cozy
I'm black like that

Comfortable in my skin
Cozy with who I am
I love myself, goddamn
Cozy, cozy (Cozy, cozy)

Unique
Unique is what you are
